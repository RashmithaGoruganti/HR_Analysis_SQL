The HR Analysis project focuses on understanding various aspects of the workforce to improve decision-making, employee retention, and overall organizational health. By analyzing employee-related data, the project aims to derive insights regarding factors influencing employee attrition, performance, diversity, and career progression.

**Key components:**

1. Investigating factors contributing to employee turnover, such as commute distance, compensation, and job satisfaction.

2. Assessing the relationship between salary hikes, job roles, and performance ratings to understand how compensation impacts employee performance.

3. Evaluating the composition of the workforce based on gender, education field, and departments to assess the level of diversity and representation.
The insights derived from this analysis help HR teams make data-driven decisions to improve retention strategies, identify areas for workforce development, and enhance overall employee experience.
